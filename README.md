## Git / deployment info

#### üå±  Branches
- Master - Production ready code.
- Stage - Test phase for completed functionality

#### ‚ùóÔ∏èGit standards
- use prefixed branches for your work. Ex: "feature/name-of-the-task" or "bugfix/the-bug-to-fix" 
- use kebab-case for branch-naming (i-am-kebab-case)
- keep commit-messages in english and try to write descriptions that explains your work (a bad example: "added styling" vs. a good example: "added styling in the top-menu" )
- To clear your git folder to bare minimum files, - run `git clean -xdf` 

#### üöÄ Deploy to stage.

1. Make sure that your local stage branch is up to date with origin/stage (do a fresh `fetch` and `pull`)
2. Merge your working branch into the stage branch
3. Push the stage branch to origin (BitBucket) 
4. ... TODO: Update when staging server is ready

### Development ###

#### Editor ####
* 4 spaces in all files

#### HTML and CSS (SCSS) ####

###### Grunt ######
We are using Grunt to package our files.
A watch function has been set up in `Gruntfile.js`.
While developing, type `grunt` into the terminal for live compiling.

###### Syntax ######

We are using BEM class naming syntax, read more at: http://getbem.com/introduction/

#### PHP ####

Some minor rules for PHP is required to follow.

When using PHP the syntax is used as so:

```
function my_function() {
    /* functionality */
}
```

When using PHP in HTML markup. The following syntax is used

```
<div class="cases">
    <?php foreach($cases as $case ) : ?>
        <div class="cases__case></div>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</div>
```

So the difference is that when using PHP by itself, we use curly braces `{}` to surround the function space. But in HTML we use `:` and `endif;` / `endforeach;` - etc.

The reason behind this is the make the code more readable in scale.
